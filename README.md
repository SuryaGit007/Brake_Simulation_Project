# Braking Simulation Project

## Overview
This project simulates braking performance using mock vehicle sensor data. Results include deceleration, time to standstill, and total braking time.

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Source code
- `data/`: Generated sensor data and simulation results

## Steps to Run
1. Open Octave and navigate to the `src` folder.
2. Run `main_simulation.m`.
3. Results will be visualized and saved in the `data` folder.

## Future Plans
- Integration with MATLAB Simulink.
